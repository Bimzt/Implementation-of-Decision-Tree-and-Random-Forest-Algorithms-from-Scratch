Predicting Music Emotion Labels Based on Acoustic Features: Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithms
1. Introduction

This User Manual Guide is compiled as a guide for using the Turkish Music Emotion Classification system developed in the file DT and RF From Scratch.ipynb.

This system utilizes the Turkish Music Emotion Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and aims to classify music emotions based on acoustic features. This system utilizes the Turkish Music Emotion Dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and aims to classify music emotions based on acoustic features.

This guide is intended for users who want to run, understand the workflow, and obtain music emotion classification results without having to understand the code details in depth.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset used is the Turkish Music Emotion Dataset, which can be downloaded from theUCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset contains acoustic features of Turkish music that are used to classify emotions.

Dataset characteristics:
- Main file name: Acoustic Features.csv
- Number of data points: 400 rows
- Number of features: 50
- Data type: Numeric
- Target: 4 classes (relaxed, happy, angry, sad)

3. System Requirements
To run the music emotion classification system, users need to ensure the following specifications:

Software:
- Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS
- Python version 3.8 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / Anaconda

Python Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

4. Dataset Preparation
- Download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Save the Acoustic Features.csv file in the same folder as the notebook file.
- Make sure the file name does not change so that it can be read by the system.

5. How to Run the Program
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab application.
- Open the Kelompok_9_Projek_Akhir_Kecerdasan_Artificial.ipynb file.
- Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom.
- Ensure there are no errors when calling the dataset and library.

6. System Workflow

The music emotion classification system works through the following stages:
- Load Dataset : Read the Acoustic Features.csv file and save it into a data structure.
- Preprocess Data : The data is cleaned and prepared for the machine learning process.
- Data Exploration (EDA) : Statistical analysis and visualization are performed to understand data patterns.
- Split Data : The dataset is divided into training and test data.
- Feature Selection : To see what percentage of features contribute to the overall dataset.
- Model Training : The machine learning model is trained using the training data.
- Model Evaluation : The model is evaluated using test data to measure accuracy and performance.
- Classification Results : The system generates music emotion predictions based on acoustic features.

7. System Output
   
The output generated by the system includes:
- Model accuracy value
- Confusion matrix
- Visualization of classification results
- Music emotion label predictions

These results are displayed directly on the notebook in text form.
